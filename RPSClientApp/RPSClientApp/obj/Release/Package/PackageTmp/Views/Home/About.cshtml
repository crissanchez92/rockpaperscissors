<h3>Web Developer</h3>
<p>Briefly, I work as a software developer, I enjoy making this kind of applications, accepting challenges and doing
    the best, looking for innovation and enhancements.</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>The solution has a Web API and the Web App Client which requests the API for sending or retrieving information
    from the database, each one of these three components are stored and runing on Azure virtual servers.</p>

<p>The objective of this implementation is that I can develop a new client application and connect it to the Web API,
    the API specification contains all the required information to request the server.</p>

<h3>Technologies</h3>
<p>I developed this application using .Net 4.5, MVC, Bootstrap, Entity Framework; I decided to use them because of the
    ease of development, you just need a couple of clicks and the framework generates most of the code. Once you have
    the skeleton the next steps are: add controllers, models, services or change the connection strings.</p>
